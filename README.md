# Password Generator
A simple yet powerful password generator designed to help you create strong and secure passwords for all your online accounts. With this application, you can easily generate complex passwords that enhance your digital security.

## Usage
This is a JavaScript code for a password generator that allows the user to customize their password by selecting the length and the types of characters (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters) to be included in the password. The code first prompts the user to enter a password length between 8 and 128 characters. It then checks if at least one type of character has been selected and if the password length is valid. If not, it will prompt the user again. Once the user has made their selections, the code generates a random password using the selected character types and displays it in the password textbox. The password can then be copied and used as needed.
